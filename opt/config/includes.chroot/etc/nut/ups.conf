###
### This file is intentionally minimal and mostly commented. Operators
### should edit it on the installed system to match their UPS model and
### connection type.

### Example: USB-connected APC UPS using the usbhid-ups driver
###
### [debvisor-ups]
###   driver = usbhid-ups
###   port = auto
###   desc = "DebVisor host UPS"
