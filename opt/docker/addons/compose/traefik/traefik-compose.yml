      # SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
      # Mounting the Docker socket gives Traefik near root-equivalent
      # access to the host. Only enable this on nodes you trust as
      # control-plane/ingress nodes and restrict who can reach Traefik's
      # dashboard/API. Consider a dedicated DebVisor profile for
      # ingress nodes if running in production.
