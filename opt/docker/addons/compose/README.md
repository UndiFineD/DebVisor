# Docker / Compose addons\n\nThis directory contains optional Docker Compose stacks that can be enabled on DebVisor nodes.\n\n## Included stacks\n\n- **Traefik reverse proxy**(`traefik/traefik-compose.yml`):\n\n- Fronts HTTP/S services and can terminate TLS for containers\n\n    running on the local Docker daemon.\n\n- **GitLab Runner**(`gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-compose.yml`):\n\n- Provides CI/CD runner capacity using the Docker executor.\n\n- **Other examples**: Additional small services intended as reference\n\n  deployments.\n\n## Enabling a stack\n\nFrom a DebVisor node with Docker installed:\n    cd docker\addons\compose\n    docker compose -f traefik/traefik-compose.yml up -d\n    docker compose -f gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-compose.yml up -d\nStacks that mount `/var/run/docker.sock` grant broad control over the\nDocker daemon. Treat hosts running these stacks as privileged control\nnodes and restrict shell access accordingly.\n\n## Disabling / rolling back\n\n- Stop and remove a stack with:\n\n  docker compose -f traefik/traefik-compose.yml down\n  docker compose -f gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-compose.yml down\n\n- Review any named volumes or bind mounts (for example the\n\n  `gitlab_runner_config` volume) that should be cleaned up or\n  preserved.\n\n## Interaction with DebVisor networking, DNS, and monitoring\n\n- Exposed ports should be integrated with the existing bridge network\n\n  and, where appropriate, registered in DNS so other nodes can reach\n  them.\n\n- For production use, consider fronting services with Kubernetes\n\n  ingress or Traefik running on dedicated nodes, and wire logs/metrics\n  into the existing monitoring stack.\n\n
