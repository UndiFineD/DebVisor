      # SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
      # The Docker executor requires access to /var/run/docker.sock,
      # which effectively grants root-equivalent control of the host.
      # Only run this stack on trusted DebVisor nodes dedicated to CI
      # work, and avoid colocating untrusted workloads on the same
      # hypervisor.
