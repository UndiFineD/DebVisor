# Placeholder monitoring stack reference (deploy real charts via Helm)
#
# This manifest is a **stub/demo only** and is not
# intended for production monitoring. It exists so that
# dashboards and alerts described in `monitoring-automation.md`
# have something to point at during early testing.
#
# For any real environment, deploy a maintained chart such as
# `kube-prometheus-stack` (Prometheus + Alertmanager + Grafana)
# with values tuned for DebVisor. See `monitoring-automation.md`
# for recommended scrape labels, recording rules, and alert
# integrations.

# This file intentionally remains minimal and should be removed
# once a proper Helm-managed monitoring stack is in place.
