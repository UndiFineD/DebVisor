# DebVisor VM registration role
#
# Installs a libvirt qemu hook script that can trigger VM-related
# registration logic (such as DNS updates) on lifecycle events.
#
# This role does not manage TSIG keys or perform DNS updates
# directly; those responsibilities belong to the on-node TSIG
# tooling and higher-level registration helpers.
