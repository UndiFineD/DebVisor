# Stub role for DebVisor RPC service addon.
#
# This role is intentionally non-operational: it does **not** deploy
# or start any RPC daemon yet. It only marks nodes where the RPC
# addon is conceptually enabled and provides a placeholder directory
# for future implementation.
#
# The long-term home for the RPC daemon and its configuration is
# expected to be `services/rpc/` (and related systemd units). When
# the RPC service is implemented, this role will be responsible for
# placing configuration, managing units, and wiring it into DebVisor's
# security model.

      DebVisor RPC addon (placeholder)

      This node has the DebVisor RPC addon enabled at the Ansible
      level, but no actual RPC/sync daemon is deployed by this
      version of the role.

      Future versions of ansible/roles/rpc-service may place
      configuration files, binaries, and systemd units under this
      directory when the RPC service is fully implemented.
