# Stub role for web panel addon.
#
# This role is intentionally non-operational: it does **not** deploy
# or start any web UI yet. It only creates a marker directory and
# README file so that nodes can be tagged as "web panel enabled".
#
# When the real DebVisor web panel is implemented, it is expected to
# live under `services/web-panel/` with its own packaging and
# systemd units. This role will then be extended to manage those
# units and configuration files.
