# DebVisor VNC/noVNC console addon (Debian 13 + nginx)
#
# Inputs (inventory/group_vars):
# - vnc_console_manage_nginx (bool, default: true): when true, this role
#   enables and starts the nginx service. Set to false if nginx is
#   managed elsewhere and you only want the VNC/noVNC assets and
#   websockify units deployed.
