      DebVisor Monitoring addon (Prometheus + node_exporter; optional Grafana
      and extra exporters)

      This node has the DebVisor monitoring stack enabled. Packages are
      expected to be available from the DebVisor image or local/offline
      repositories; this role does not attempt to reach the public
      internet.

      Prometheus and node_exporter run with their default Debian
      configurations. When enabled via the Ansible variable
      `monitoring_stack_install_grafana: true`, Grafana runs as
      `grafana-server` and requires further provisioning (dashboards,
      data sources) via other DebVisor tooling or manual
      configuration.

      Additional, optional monitoring extras can be enabled via
      Ansible variables:

      - `monitoring_extra_dns: true` enables simple Bind9/dnsmasq
        health probes and textfile metrics (if the helper scripts are
        present on this node).
      - `monitoring_extra_services: true` enables lightweight service
        state checks for core systemd units, exported via textfiles.
      - `monitoring_extra_storage: true` is reserved for future ZFS
        and Ceph exporters on storage nodes.
