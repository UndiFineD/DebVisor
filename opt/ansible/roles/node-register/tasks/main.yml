# Stub role: node-register
# This role is a placeholder for future node registration flows.
# Expected integration paths:
# - Built-in hostname-register.service and helpers
# - RPC/web-panel driven flows
# - AWX/Ansible Controller job templates
# Keep this stub aligned with the real control paths as they evolve.
