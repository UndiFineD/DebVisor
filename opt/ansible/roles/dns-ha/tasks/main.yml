# dns-ha role
#
# This role is responsible for deploying a highly-available
# Bind9-based DNS pair with Keepalived and DNS-facing nftables rules.
#
# It deliberately DOES NOT generate or rotate TSIG secrets itself.
# TSIG material is managed by the dedicated TSIG rotation service
# (see tsig-rotate.service / tsig-rotate.timer and related scripts).
#
# The templates used here (named.conf.local.j2, tsig-*.conf.j2, zone
# files, keepalived.conf.j2, nftables-dns.conf.j2) are expected to
# reference TSIG key files that are provisioned and refreshed by that
# service.
