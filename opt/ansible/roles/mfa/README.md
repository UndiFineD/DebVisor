# MFA Role (Stub)\n\nThis role is a non-operational stub kept in sync with DebVisor's real control paths for MFA enforcement. Use `ansible/playbooks/enforce-mfa.yml` and eventual RPC/web-panel workflows or AWX job templates for actual enforcement.\n\n- Purpose: Document intended integration points without performing system changes.\n\n- Future integration: System policy tasks, RPC/web workflows, AWX templates.\n\n- Note: This role intentionally does not modify PAM/sshd or fetch packages.\n
