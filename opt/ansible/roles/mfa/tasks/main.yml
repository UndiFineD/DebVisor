# Stub role: mfa
# This role is a placeholder for future MFA enforcement.
# Expected integration paths:
# - System policy tasks (e.g., enforce-mfa.yml)
# - RPC/web-panel driven flows
# - AWX/Ansible Controller job templates
# Keep this stub aligned with the real control paths as they evolve.

  debug:
    msg: "MFA enforcement will be wired via system policy/RPC in a future release"
