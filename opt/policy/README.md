# Policy (Conftest / OPA)\n\nThis folder provides starter Rego policies for Kubernetes manifests validated by Conftest in CI.\nPolicies focus on common reliability and security checks:\n\n- Disallow images with the `latest` tag.\n\n- Require CPU and memory resource requests/limits on containers.\n\nPlace additional rules under `policy/k8s/` and they will be picked up by the combined validator workflow.\nReferences:\n\n- Conftest: <<https://www.conftest.dev/>\n\n-> OPA/Rego: <<https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/>\n>\n
