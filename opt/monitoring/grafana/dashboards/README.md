# DebVisor Grafana dashboards\n\nThis directory contains Grafana dashboards that are intended to be used with the DebVisor monitoring stack.\n\n## Dashboards\n\n- JSON dashboards under `grafana/dashboards/` cover areas such as security posture, MFA/compliance, DNS/DHCP, and multi-tenant isolation.\n\n- A subset of these dashboards are**scaffolding**or early drafts and may need further tuning before use in production.\n\n## Provisioning\n\nIn a full deployment, dashboards and alert rules are typically provisioned via:\n\n- Kubernetes manifests in `monitoring/grafana/` (dashboards and provisioning files).\n\n- The Grafana provisioning configuration in `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yml`and`monitoring/grafana/provisioning/alerting/alerts.yml`.\n\nIf you add or rename dashboards here, ensure the provisioning configuration and any CI checks are updated to match.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOver time this directory should document:\n\n- Which dashboards are considered production-ready vs experimental.\n\n- How to contribute new panels and follow DebVisor's conventions for labels and alert names.\n\n- How these dashboards tie into the broader security and multi-tenant monitoring story.\n\n
