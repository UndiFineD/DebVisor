# Synthetic Metrics Fixtures (Optional)\n\nDebVisor includes optional synthetic metrics fixtures to help test dashboards and alerting in environments without real workloads.\n\n- Delivery: ConfigMap manifests under `monitoring/fixtures/*.yaml`.\n\n- Optional: Not applied by default; enable per environment as needed.\n\n- Scope: Minimal noise; aim for realistic shapes without masking real signals.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Apply a fixture ConfigMap manually to a test cluster:\n\n    kubectl apply -f monitoring/fixtures/edge-lab.yaml\n\n- Remove when done:\n\n    kubectl delete -f monitoring/fixtures/edge-lab.yaml\n\n- Optionally deploy the synthetic metrics generator and Service:\n\n    kubectl apply -f monitoring/fixtures/edge-lab-deployment.yaml\n\n- Teardown the generator when finished:\n\n    kubectl delete -f monitoring/fixtures/edge-lab-deployment.yaml\n\n## Authoring New Fixtures\n\n- Create a new file `monitoring/fixtures/.yaml`.\n\n- Use a ConfigMap to carry small synthetic series definitions; larger generators should live in a dedicated Deployment.\n\n- Keep naming consistent (prefix `debvisor-fixture-`).\n\n- Document intended use and limits in comments.\n\n## Building a Custom Generator Image (Optional)\n\nDebVisor includes a tiny generator based on `prometheus_client`:\n\n- Source: `monitoring/fixtures/generator/`\n\n- Build locally:\n\n    docker build -t debvisor/synthetic-metrics:local monitoring/fixtures/generator\n\n- Use in the provided Deployment (`edge-lab-deployment.yaml`already references`debvisor/synthetic-metrics:local`).\n\nIf you prefer a registry, push the image and update the Deployment `image:` accordingly.\n\n## Using a Published Image (GHCR)\n\nA GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes multi-arch images to GHCR:\n\n- Workflow: `.github/workflows/push-generator.yml`\n\n- Tags: `ghcr.io//synthetic-metrics:latest` and a commit tag.\n\n- The deployment references `ghcr.io//synthetic-metrics:latest` by default.\n\nYou can override `REPO_OWNER` via environment to point the Deployment at a different owner if needed.\n\n## Example Contents\n\n- Example below sets up a simple time-series generator for edge lab demos.\n\n- Metrics are exposed via `/metrics` using a small sidecar (when deployed) or consumed by an existing collector.\n\nSee `edge-lab.yaml` for a simple, self-documented example.\nSee `edge-lab-deployment.yaml` for an optional generator Deployment and Service.\n
