# DebVisor Security Overview\n\nThis document summarizes the baseline security posture for the DebVisor ISO,\ninstaller, and installed system. It is intentionally concise; see the\nreferenced docs for deeper architecture.\n\n## ISO Integrity\n\n- Every released ISO SHOULD be accompanied by a SHA256 checksum file.\n\n- Optionally, ISOs MAY be signed with a GPG key dedicated to DebVisor\n\n  releases.\n\n- The build script supports this via:\n\n- `DEBVISOR_SIGN_ISO=1` to enable checksum + signature generation.\n\n- `DEBVISOR_GPG_KEY=` to select a specific GPG key (optional).\n\nExample (after importing the DebVisor release key):\n    sha256sum -c debvisor--.hybrid.iso.sha256\n    gpg --verify debvisor--.hybrid.iso.asc\n\n## ISO and Live Environment\n\n- The live environment aims to ship only the packages required to install and\n\n  operate DebVisor as a headless hypervisor.\n\n- Network-facing services in the live system SHOULD be minimized. SSH or other\n\n  daemons SHOULD only be enabled when explicitly required for installation or\n  remote automation.\n\n- Default firewall policy SHOULD deny inbound traffic unless explicitly\n\n  documented as required for the installer.\n\n## Installation and First Boot\n\n- The first-boot script (`debvisor-firstboot.sh`) is intended to be\n\n  non-destructive when run in `--dry-run` mode, and its behavior is covered by\n  `build/test-firstboot.sh`.\n\n- The installed system MUST NOT ship with default or well-known passwords.\n\n  Installers SHOULD either:\n\n- Require a strong password at install time, or\n\n- Prefer SSH key-based administration with no password login.\n\n- The installed host SHOULD disable or remove services that are not required\n\n  for a headless hypervisor (e.g., GUI components, desktop daemons, printers).\n\n## Updates and Maintenance\n\n- Security updates SHOULD be applied regularly. Operators are encouraged to\n\n  enable unattended upgrades for security repositories where operationally\n  compatible.\n\n- Logs from first boot and key management actions SHOULD be written to a\n\n  dedicated location (e.g., `/var/log/debvisor/`) to ease auditing.\n\n## Operational Guidance\n\n- Expose DebVisor management interfaces only over trusted channels\n\n  (VPN, bastion hosts, or private networks).\n\n- Avoid exposing management SSH or web consoles directly to the public\n\n  internet without additional controls (firewalls, MFA, IP restrictions).\n\n- Periodically review the package set and configuration against current\n\n  hardening guidance for Debian and virtualization hosts.\nExample threat scenarios, trust boundaries, and supply-chain\nassumptions are summarized in `threat-model.md`; site operators may\nhave stricter policies that take precedence over these defaults.\n\n## Blocklists and Whitelists\n\nDebVisor ships**example**blocklist and whitelist files under\n`/etc/debvisor/`:\n\n- `blocklist-example.txt`\n\n- `blocklist-whitelist-example.txt`\n\nThese are templates only; they are not active unless wired into the\n`blocklist`Ansible role via inventory or`group_vars` (see\n`operations.md`). Operators should copy and adapt these files, then\nreference the real paths from Ansible configuration.\nUsing the example files as-is without connecting them to Ansible has\nno effect on the running firewall.\nThis document is a starting point. Site operators may have stricter policies\nthat take precedence over these defaults.\n
